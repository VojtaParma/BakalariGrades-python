# Grade Exporter Project for School Management Systems 🎓

## Overview 🚀
This project is designed to facilitate the export of student grades from school management systems using **Python** and **CSV** for compatibility. It aims to streamline data management for teachers and administrators by providing an efficient solution for exporting and organizing grades.

**Important Note**: This project is still under development and not yet fully functional.

## Components 🔧
1. **Python** 🐍
2. School Management System with grade export capabilities 📚
3. **CSV files** for data handling 📑
4. Libraries: 
   - `pandas`
   - `selenium`
   - `openpyxl`
5. Chrome WebDriver for automated browser interactions 🌐

---

## Features ✨
- Automates login to the Bakaláři system.
- Exports grades from the online system into a structured Excel file.
- Counts occurrences of each grade (1 to 5) and organizes data for analysis.
- **User-friendly** and adaptable for other school systems.

---

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Login Automation**: Selenium automates the login process by filling in credentials and navigating to the grades page.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extracts grade data from the Bakaláři system's table.
3. **Processing**: Counts occurrences of each grade and formats the data.
4. **Export**: Saves the processed data into an Excel file (`znamky_pocet.xlsx`) for further use.

## Limitations 🛠️
- **In Progress**: The project is not fully functional; some features, such as dynamic adaptability to all school systems, require further development.
- **Credentials**: Hardcoded credentials need to be replaced with secure input methods.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is still under development.
